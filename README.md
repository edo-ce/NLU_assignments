# NLU Project Assignments 2023/24

### Edoardo Cecchinato (247434)

To run the code you should enter a part folder for an assignment and run the file main.py.
This is an example of how to run assignment LM part 1:
```console
disi@lab000001:~/edoardo_cecchinato_247434$ cd LM/part_1
disi@lab000001:~/edoardo_cecchinato_247434/LM/part_1$ python3 main.py
```

Every folder contains a README.md file that specify how to run testing (default) or training, and how 
change between different steps inside the exercise.

Any implementation discussion can be found in the submitted reports.
